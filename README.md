# VAE-Pretrain-InverseDesign
This repository presents a physics-informed VAE-based inverse design framework for alloy composition discovery driven by tensile curves. It integrates VAE pretraining, tensile-curve inverse mapping, and latent-space genetic optimization to enable continuous, physically consistent, and interpretable composition design.
